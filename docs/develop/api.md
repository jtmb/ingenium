# API Reference

## Overview

The Ingenium REST API runs on port 4097 and is the sole database authority. All data flows through HTTP to this API. Port 1455 is mapped from host loopback (`127.0.0.1:1455`) to the API's port 4097 inside the container, serving as the OAuth callback proxy for native OpenCode provider integrations.

## Public Endpoints (Before Auth Middleware)

The following endpoint is registered **before** the auth middleware and rate limiter, allowing it to receive browser redirects without authentication:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/auth/callback` | OAuth callback receiver for native OpenCode provider integrations. Validates state/code from `pendingOAuthAttempts` Map (10-min TTL). Supports both **auto mode** (forwards to OpenCode's internal `localhost:1455/auth/callback` listener) and **code mode** (completes via OpenCodeClient). State is consumed on first use to prevent redirect replay. Malformed states (>1024 chars or containing control chars) rejected with 400. |

## Startup Behavior

The API performs the following at startup (in order):

1. **Listen on port** — The Express server starts accepting connections immediately
2. **Ensure global project** — `ensureGlobalProject()` idempotently creates the `global-default` project if it does not exist. This is required by the scheduler (synthesis interval resolution) and the email engine (account storage). Local development benefits from the same auto-bootstrap as Docker deployments.
3. **Start scheduler** — The synthesis, mail sync, job cron, and lock cleanup schedulers begin their cycles after a staggered delay.
4. **WAL checkpoint + integrity check** — Runs `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` and `integrity_check` to ensure the DB is healthy before the scheduler writes data.
5. **Start email engine** — Deferred by 10 seconds to let the DB fully initialize. If `getGlobalProjectId()` fails (no global project), the engine start is skipped with a warning.

### Graceful Degradation

If the global project is unavailable:

- **Health endpoint** (`GET /api/v1/health`) — responds with `200 OK` even with zero projects
- **Mail sync** — skips silently with a `debug`-level log: `"Skipping mail sync — no global project configured"`
- **Synthesis** — reads interval from the env var default (15 min) and logs that no global project is configured
- **All other routes** — operate normally on a per-project basis

See the [startup regression tests](../../services/ingenium-api/tests/startup.test.ts) for coverage of these scenarios.

## Configuration

- **Port**: 4097 (configurable via `INGENIUM_API_PORT`)
- **Body limit**: `express.json({ limit: "2mb" })` for large skill/plugin uploads
- **Security**: helmet for security headers (default configuration — no custom CSP), CORS (configurable via `CORS_ORIGIN`), optional bearer token auth
- **Rate limits**: Three independent in-memory sliding-window rate limiters:

  | Limiter | Default | Applies To | Location |
  |---------|---------|------------|----------|
  | General API | 100 req/min per IP | All authenticated routes (before auth middleware to throttle brute-force) | `lib/middleware/rate-limit.ts` |
  | Vault | 5 req/min per IP | All `/api/v1/vault/*` routes | `scripts/api-server.ts:134` |
  | OAuth callback | 20 req/min per IP | `GET /auth/callback` (public, before auth) | `lib/routes/opencode.ts:97-98` |

  > Rate limit state is in-memory only — resets on process restart. Suitable for single-instance deployments with supervisord restarts. For multi-replica deployments, replace with Redis or an external store.

- **CSP**: Helmet's default Content-Security-Policy is applied. No custom CSP directives are configured. Iframe sandboxing is handled via the `sandbox` attribute on embedded iframes (see [Iframe Sandbox](../security/iframe-sandbox.md)), not via CSP `frame-ancestors`. CSP expansion remains deferred (see [Deferred Items in iframe-sandbox.md](../security/iframe-sandbox.md#-deferred-requires-runtime-testing)).

### Settings — LLM Config

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/provider-configs` | Read the ordered managed provider collection. Each provider block returns: `id`, `name`, `npm`, `baseURL`, `models`, `defaultModel`, `roles: ("available"\|"primary"\|"backup")[]`, `enabled`, `allowPrivateNetwork: boolean`, and `apiKeySet: boolean` — **the actual API key is never returned**. Falls back to legacy primary/backup settings until the collection is first saved. At most one provider may have `primary` in its roles array and at most one may have `backup`. Also returns `synthesis` object with `{ primary: { providerId, modelId }, secondary: { providerId, modelId } }` — the explicit synthesis provider+model selection, which may differ from the role-derived defaults. |
| PUT | `/api/v1/settings/provider-configs` | Atomically save any number of provider blocks. Accepts `roles` array and/or legacy `role` scalar (`available`\|`primary`\|`backup`) for backwards compatibility. `roles` supports multi-role: `["available", "primary"]` or `["available", "backup"]`. Also accepts an optional `synthesis` body field with `{ primary?: SynthesisSelection, secondary?: SynthesisSelection }` to override the role-derived synthesis provider selections — enabling same-provider different-model configurations. Validates exclusivity (at most one primary, at most one backup), synthesis selection constraints (cannot select the same provider+model for both primary and secondary), endpoint SSRF policy via `validateEndpointUrl`, and `allowPrivateNetwork` flag. Projects into OpenCode global config and mirrors synthesis selections into synthesis settings. API keys are stored in the encrypted vault (`vault_items` table, AES-256-GCM). |
| GET | `/api/v1/settings/llm-config` | Read atomic primary+backup LLM config. Returns provider, model, endpoint, `allowPrivateNetwork`, and `apiKeySet: boolean` — **the actual API key is never exposed**. API keys are stored in the vault, never in plaintext settings. Legacy `synthesis_api_key`/`synthesis_backup_api_key`/`llm_provider_api_keys` settings are auto-migrated into the vault on first read and then deleted from the settings table. |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings/llm-config` | Legacy primary+backup save contract retained for existing clients. New clients should use `PUT /provider-configs`. Accepts `allowPrivateNetwork` on primary and backup blocks. API keys are stored in the vault. |
| POST | `/api/v1/settings/test-llm` | Test an LLM connection. Accepts `allowPrivateNetwork` boolean body field. Rejects unsafe/internal endpoint addresses (same `validateEndpointUrl` guard as provider-configs save). On transport failure, returns `{ ok: false, status: 0, message: "Unable to reach LLM endpoint" }` — the endpoint URL is never reflected in error messages. |

### Pipeline

|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/pipeline/events` | List pipeline events |
| GET | `/api/v1/pipeline/timeline` | Get grouped timeline |

| POST | `/unseal` | Unseal vault with passphrase. When called from the dashboard (`x-ingenium-ui: dashboard` header present) on an uninitialized vault, returns `503 VAULT_NOT_INITIALIZED` — the Dashboard must redirect to `/initialize`. For MCP/programmatic clients, auto-initializes on first use. Returns `403` on invalid passphrase. |

| GET | `/restore/:jobId` | Get restore job status |
| GET | `/schedule` | Get backup schedule configuration |
| PUT | `/schedule` | Set backup schedule configuration |

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/status` | List all process and application statuses |
| GET | `/:name` | Single process detail via supervisord `getProcessInfo` (ingenium-api, ingenium-dashboard, opencode-web, ttyd-opencode) |

### OpenCode Integration Routes

Provider integration routes prefixed with `/api/v1/opencode`. The `GET /auth/callback` endpoint is a public route (before auth middleware) — see [Public Endpoints](#public-endpoints-before-auth-middleware).

|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/integrations` | List all native OpenCode integrations (provider auth metadata, connection methods) |
| GET | `/integrations/:id` | Get a single native integration by ID |
| POST | `/integrations/:id/connect/oauth` | Begin an OAuth integration attempt. Returns `{ attemptID, url, mode: "auto"\|"code", instructions }`. State stored in `pendingOAuthAttempts` with 10-min TTL. The returned URL is validated for SSRF safety before being returned. |
| POST | `/integrations/:id/connect/key` | Connect via API key. Accepts `{ key }` in body. |
| POST | `/integrations/complete` | Complete an OAuth code-mode attempt. Accepts `{ attemptID, code }`. |
| POST | `/integrations/attempts/:id/cancel` | Cancel a pending OAuth attempt. |
| GET | `/integrations/attempts/:id` | Poll OAuth attempt status. Returns `{ status: "pending"\|"complete"\|"failed"\|"expired", message? }`. |
| GET | `/builtin-providers` | Runtime OpenCode Zen free model discovery — queries OpenCode runtime provider catalog, filters to only free models. |
| GET | `/chat-config` | Sanitized merged provider catalog for the Chat page (managed + builtin). |

## OpenCode Proxy Routes

The API proxies requests to the OpenCode server at :4098. HTTP Basic Auth credentials are injected server-side (never exposed to the browser). All proxy routes require `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to be set (returns 503 otherwise). SSE routes stream `text/event-stream` with proper caching and buffering headers.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/health` | OpenCode server health |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions` | List sessions |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions` | Create session |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/status` | Session status (literal path — before `:id`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id` | Get session detail |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id` | Update session |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id` | Delete session |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/messages` | Get messages (with optional `limit` and `before` pagination) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/messages/:msgId` | Get a single message |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/messages/:msgId` | Delete a message |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/prompt` | Send prompt (body uses `parts` array per v1.18.3 contract) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/abort` | Abort session |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/fork` | Fork session |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/share` | Share session |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/share` | Unshare session |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/compact` | Compact session |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/revert` | Revert session to a message/part checkpoint |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/unrevert` | Unrevert session |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/children` | Get session children (forked sessions) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/diff` | Get session diff (optional `messageID` query param) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/command` | Send a command (slash commands) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/init` | Initialize a session |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/events` | SSE event stream (per-session) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/events` | Global SSE event stream (no session filter) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/chat-config` | **Sanitized Chat config** — returns `{ configured, primary, backup, providers: [...], agents, defaultSelection }`. The `providers[]` array merges managed entries (`source: "managed"`) with the runtime-discovered OpenCode Zen builtin entry (`source: "builtin"`). `defaultSelection` picks the managed primary provider first, falls back to the OpenCode Zen runtime default, then the first provider. No API keys are exposed. OpenCode live-reloads provider config changes — no restart required. The `primary` and `backup` fields reflect the explicit synthesis provider+model selection from `llm_provider_configs`, which may differ from the role-derived defaults. Returns `{ configured: false, defaultSelection: null }` when no LLM is set up and no builtin is available. |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/builtin-providers` | **Runtime OpenCode Zen free model discovery** — queries the OpenCode runtime provider catalog, filters to only free models (`cost.input === 0 && cost.output === 0`) from the `opencode` provider ID. Response: `{ data: { providerId, providerName, models: [{id, name, providerID}], defaultModel, source: "runtime" } }`. When OpenCode is unreachable, returns `{ models: [], defaultModel: null, source: "unavailable" }`. Sanitized — no `apiKey`, `options`, or `env` fields leak through. |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/providers` | List providers + models |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/agents` | List agents |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/mcp` | MCP server status |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/mcp/:name/connect` | Connect MCP server |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/mcp/:name/disconnect` | Disconnect MCP server |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/permissions` | Pending permissions (global) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/sessions/:id/permissions/:permId` | Reply to a permission request (session-scoped) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opencode/upload` | File upload for chat attachments (multipart, validated MIME allowlist) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opencode/questions` | Pending questions (read-only; no reply endpoint in v1.18.3) |

> **Security**: The Chat and provider-config endpoints return only provider metadata and key-presence flags. **API keys are never exposed or written to OpenCode config files.** Credentials are stored in the encrypted vault (`vault_items` table with AES-256-GCM), separated from provider metadata, synchronized to OpenCode through its auth API, and mirrored into the selected synthesis settings for runtime resolution. Legacy plaintext settings (`synthesis_api_key`, `synthesis_backup_api_key`, `llm_provider_api_keys`) are auto-migrated into the vault on first read and then deleted from the settings table.

> **Known gap**: Questions cannot be replied to via the REST API in v1.18.3. They are TUI-only — delivered through the control channel. There is no `POST /questions/:id/reply` endpoint.

## Data Flow

```
Dashboard → HTTP → API → Core → SQLite
MCP Server → HTTP → API → Core → SQLite
Email Client → OAuth2 + Gmail REST API / SMTP → Gmail Provider
```

### API-First Frontend
- Dashboard imports ZERO core/server code. All data via HTTP to API.
- MCP server talks to the API over HTTP. Zero DB access.

### Response Format

**Success:**
```typescript
{ "data": T, "total"?: number }
```

**Error:**
```typescript
{ "error": { "code": string, "message": string } }
```
