description: "Create, update, and retire skills as projects evolve. Detects patterns (new frameworks, repeated conventions, missing coverage) and creates new skills autonomously. Covers both target-project skill management and bootstrap repo maintenance. Use when the codebase has grown new patterns, added dependencies, or when conventions have drifted."

# Update Skills — AI-Driven Skill Management

## What This Skill Covers

Skills are living documents — they should grow and change as the project grows. This skill teaches you how to **detect** when a project needs new or updated skills, **create** them with proper structure, and **retire** ones that are no longer relevant.

It covers two audiences:
- **Project developers** — managing skills in `.agents/skills/` as your project evolves
- **Bootstrap maintainers** — maintaining the source skills in `.agents/skills/`

## When to Use

- After adding a new framework, library, or tool to a project
- When you notice the same convention being repeated across files without a skill
- When an existing skill's instructions are outdated or wrong
- When a framework version bump changes conventions
- When a pattern (testing strategy, API pattern, file layout) has solidified and should be codified

---

# Part 1: Managing Skills in Your Project

Skills live at `.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` in your project. They're invoked by name via slash command in any AI coding assistant that supports the `.agents/` convention (e.g., `/my-project-conventions`). Each skill has:

```yaml
---
name: {must-match-folder-name}
description: "What this covers and when to use it. Be keyword-rich for AI discovery."

## Detection: Finding Skill Candidates

Before every coding session — and whenever you touch a new area of a project — scan for these signals. When you find one, **act immediately** — no need to ask. The agent audits, fixes, and creates autonomously. These signals cover not just skills but also agent definitions, hooks, plugins, documentation drift, and missing learnings entries. Any change to the skill system pipeline should be self-detected and self-corrected.

### Signal 1 — New Framework or Dependency

**Trigger:** A `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, or `Gemfile` contains a dependency not covered by any existing skill.

| If you see | Create a skill for |
|------------|-------------------|
| `express`, `fastify`, `hono` | Node.js server conventions |
| `django`, `flask`, `fastapi` (new) | That framework's conventions |
| `prisma`, `drizzle`, `sqlalchemy` | ORM conventions |
| `graphql`, `apollo`, `relay` | GraphQL conventions |
| `tailwindcss`, `sass`, `styled-components` | Styling conventions |
| `vitest`, `playwright`, `cypress` | Testing conventions |
| `terraform`, `pulumi` | IaC conventions |
| `docker-compose` with new services | Service-specific container conventions |
| `storybook` | Component documentation conventions |
| `eslint`, `prettier` (custom config) | Linting/formatting conventions |
| `github-actions`, `circleci` | CI/CD conventions |
| `nx`, `turborepo`, `lerna` | Monorepo tooling conventions (build orchestration) |
| New `.proto` files | gRPC/Protobuf conventions |
| Multiple services in one repo, `services/` or `packages/` dirs | `project-structure` skill — monorepo layout, service layering, boundaries |

### Signal 2 — Repeated Conventions Without a Skill

**Trigger:** Across multiple files, you see the same pattern that isn't documented in a skill.

**Detection checklist:**
- Three or more files follow the same naming pattern (e.g., `use*` hooks, `*Service` classes, `*Repository` interfaces)
- Consistent error handling that differs from the framework default
- A directory structure that repeats (e.g., every feature has `components/`, `hooks/`, `tests/`)
- Comments that say "remember to..." or "always..." (these are unwritten conventions)
- PR review comments that repeat the same feedback
- A `CONTRIBUTING.md` or wiki page with rules not in any skill
- A `packages/core/` directory with shared tool logic → needs `project-structure` skill
- A `services/api/` directory with route files + middleware → needs `api-design` skill
- A `services/dashboard/` directory that only calls an API → needs `nextjs-conventions` skill
- A `services/server/` directory with MCP transport logic → needs `api-design` + `project-structure` skills
- `eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` — every customized rule is a convention worth documenting
- CI pipeline steps that enforce project-specific checks
- `.env.example` or config files with project-specific environment variables

### Signal 3 — Missing Coverage

**Trigger:** A file type or directory has no applicable skill.

**Detection checklist:**
- `**/*.graphql` or `**/*.gql` files exist → no GraphQL skill
- `**/*.proto` files exist → no Protobuf skill
- `**/*.tf` files exist → no Terraform skill
- `**/*.yml` in `.agents/workflows/` → no CI skill
- `**/*.mdx` files → no MDX/docs skill
- `**/migrations/` directory → no migration-specific skill
- `**/scripts/` directory with `.sh`/`.py`/`.ts` → no script conventions
- `**/test/` or `**/__tests__/` with patterns → no test conventions skill
- `**/i18n/` or `**/locales/` → no internationalization skill
- `**/*.env*` files → no environment config skill
- `packages/*/lib/tools/` files exist → no shared-library conventions skill
- `services/*/lib/middleware/` files exist → no middleware conventions skill
- `services/*/lib/routes/` files organized by resource → `api-design` skill should be active

### Signal 4 — Deprecated or Drifted Content

**Trigger:** An existing skill says something that's no longer true.

**Detection checklist:**
- Skill references a package version that's been bumped (e.g., "use React 18 patterns" but `package.json` has React 19)
- Skill says "use X" but the codebase has migrated to Y
- Skill references a file path that no longer exists
- Skill mentions a command that fails (`npx outdated-script` → error)
- A skill hasn't been updated in months but the codebase is active
- Build/lint/test commands in the skill differ from what CI actually runs

### Signal 5 — Unlogged Changes

**Trigger:** Files changed in agents, hooks, plugins, deploy, or config but no corresponding entry was added to `.agents/skills/learnings.md`.

**Detection checklist:**
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` shows `.opencode/agents/` changes but no learnings.md entry for agent changes
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` shows `.agents/hooks/` changes but no learnings.md entry for hook changes
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` shows `.opencode/plugins/` changes but no learnings.md entry for plugin changes
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` shows `opencode.json` changes but no learnings.md entry for config changes
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` shows `.agents/` changes across multiple categories but no learnings.md entries
- A `git log --oneline -5` shows commits that mention "agent", "plugin", "config", "hook" but no corresponding commit touches `.agents/skills/learnings.md`

**The fix:** Run `git log --oneline -5` and `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` to identify what changed, then create the missing learnings.md entry. If the changes were already committed, still log to learnings.md with the commit hash — the entry documents what happened even if it's retrospective.

### Signal 6 — Documentation Drift

**Trigger:** The project's documentation (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/TECH-STACK.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/README.md`) is out of sync with the actual file structure, agent definitions, or skill content.

**Detection checklist:**
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~5` shows `.opencode/agents/*.md` changes but `docs/agents.md` hasn't been updated (agent table stale, profiles missing new agents)
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~5` shows `.agents/skills/*` changes but skill count in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` hasn't been updated
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~5` shows `.agents/hooks/` or `.opencode/plugins/` changes but `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` hooks/plugins sections are stale
- `git diff --name-only HEAD~5` shows `opencode.json` changes but `docs/TECH-STACK.md` integrations/config table is stale
- Agent permission changes (edit/write/bash) documented in `.opencode/agents/*.md` that aren't reflected in `docs/agents.md` profile tables
- The `orchestrator-primer` skill was added but not mentioned in any docs
- Pipeline flow or delegation model changed but `docs/agents.md` workflow diagrams are stale

**Detection commands:**
```bash
# Find docs that haven't been updated along with code changes
for agent_file in .opencode/agents/*/ingenium-*.md; do
  agent_basename=$(basename "$agent_file" .md)
  if git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep -q "$agent_basename"; then
    if ! git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep -q "docs/agents.md"; then
      echo "STALE: $agent_file changed but docs/agents.md not updated"
    fi
  fi
done

# Check if skill count in ARCHITECTURE.md matches actual count
actual_skills=$(ls -d .agents/skills/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
grep -oP '\d+(?= skills)' docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | while read doc_count; do
  if [ "$doc_count" -ne "$actual_skills" ]; then
    echo "STALE: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md says $doc_count skills, actual is $actual_skills"
  fi
done
```

**The fix:** Read the stale doc, compare it to the actual state, and apply targeted updates. Run the doc count check above to validate. After fixing, run:
```bash
grep -c '|' docs/agents.md                       # verify agent table has rows
ls -d .agents/skills/*/ | wc -l                   # verify skill count
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep 'docs/'       # verify docs were changed
```

## Creation: Writing a New Skill

When you've identified a candidate, create it immediately. No approval needed.

### Step 1 — Choose the Name

The folder name **must** match the `name` field. Rules:
- **Framework skills:** `{framework}-conventions` (e.g., `django-conventions`, `express-conventions`)
- **Domain skills:** `{domain}` (e.g., `graphql`, `i18n`, `storybook`)
- **Project-specific:** `{project}-{area}` (e.g., `myapp-auth`, `myapp-testing`)
- **Kebab-case only.** No underscores, no uppercase.

### Step 2 — Write the SKILL.md

Template:

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: "{One sentence: what this covers and when to use it. Include framework names, file types, and trigger keywords.}"
---

# {Skill Title}

## When to Use

- list specific triggers: file types, directories, tasks
- be explicit so the AI knows exactly when to invoke this skill

## {Topic 1} — {Mandatory/Optional}

Convention content here. Use these patterns:
- **Bold rules** for mandatory conventions
- Code blocks for commands and examples
- Tables for comparisons and references
- Checklists for multi-step procedures

## {Topic 2}

...

## Testing & Verification

How to verify these conventions are followed:
- Which lint rules enforce this?
- Which test patterns validate this?
- Which CI step catches violations?
```

### Step 3 — Add Scripts (If Needed)

If the skill needs executable code, create `scripts/`:

```
.agents/skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── check-conventions.sh   ← executable, validates conventions
```

### Step 4 — Add References (If Needed)

For skills that need external docs loaded on demand:

```
.agents/skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── api-reference.md       ← detailed API docs, loaded when needed
```

### Tests Go in `tests/`, Not in Skills

Tests for the skill system itself — validation scripts, audit helpers, self-improving pipeline tests — belong in `tests/` at the project root, alongside `docs/`. They should **never** be placed in individual skill directories — skills are documentation, not test harnesses.

**If `tests/` doesn't exist, create it.** The `useful-tests` skill covers testing conventions; any test script added to `tests/` should follow those patterns.

### Step 5 — Commit, Then Log to learnings.md

**Always commit changes before logging.** This ensures every learnings entry has a verifiable commit hash.

1. **Commit all changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "skill({name}): {brief description of what changed}"
   ```

2. **Capture the commit hash:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --short HEAD
   ```

3. **Append to `.agents/skills/learnings.md`** with the change details. Use this expanded template that covers all categories:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — {short-topic}

- **Commit**: `{short-hash}` (after)
- **Before**: `{short-hash}` (if reverting, snapshot before)
- **Category**: skill | agent | hook | plugin | deploy | config | architecture | bug | pattern
- **Changes**: {one-line summary of what changed}
- **Why**: {what triggered this change}
```

This creates a changelog where every entry is traceable to a specific commit. The category tag enables grep-based filtering:
- `grep "Category: skill" .agents/skills/learnings.md` — all skill changes
- `grep "Category: agent" .agents/skills/learnings.md` — all agent changes

### Step 6 — Validate

```bash
# Check name matches folder
SKILL_DIR=".agents/skills/my-skill"
grep "^name:" "$SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md" | grep -q "$(basename $SKILL_DIR)" && echo "OK" || echo "NAME MISMATCH"

# Check frontmatter fences
head -1 "$SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md" | grep -q "^---$" && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING OPENING FENCE"
```

## Update: Refreshing an Existing Skill

When a skill is outdated:

1. **Read the skill** fully — understand what it currently says
2. **Read the codebase** — find the files the skill covers, check current patterns
3. **Diff the changes** — what's different between skill and reality?
4. **Update the skill** — fix outdated commands, versions, paths, and conventions
5. **Check for cascading updates** — if this skill says "see also X", check X too
6. **Update docs** — if `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` references this skill, update it in the same turn
7. **Test** — invoke the skill via its slash command and verify it gives correct guidance

## Retire: Removing a Stale Skill

When a skill is no longer relevant:

1. **Verify it's truly unused** — grep the codebase for the pattern it covers
2. **Check for references** — does any other skill or doc link to it?
3. **Delete the directory** — `rm -rf .agents/skills/{name}/`
4. **Update docs** — remove references from `docs/` and skill listings
5. **Update bootstrap.sh** — if this was a framework overlay, remove from the FILES array

---

# Part 2: Maintaining the Bootstrap Repo

This section is for maintainers of the Ingenium repo itself. Source skills live at `.agents/skills/` and are copied to `.agents/skills/` in target projects by `bootstrap.sh`.

## The Skill Architecture

Before making any change, understand which layer you're touching:

1. **Core** (`generic-conventions/SKILL.md`) — affects ALL projects. Change with caution.
2. **Framework skills** (`.agents/skills/{fw}-conventions/SKILL.md`) — copied when `--framework {fw}` is selected.
3. **Cross-cutting skills** (`.agents/skills/{domain}/SKILL.md`) — Containers, Shell, SQL, API Design, Kubernetes, TypeScript. Copied to all targets.
4. **Core skills** (`generic-conventions`) — always copied.
5. **Task skills** (`generate-docs`, `repo-context`, `write-docs`, `update-skills`) — optional. Invocable via `/` command.
6. **Enforcement** (`.agents/hooks/`) — deterministic lifecycle hooks.
7. **CI** (`.agents/workflows/ci.yml`) — matrix CI for lint/build/test.

## Procedure: Add a New Framework Skill

1. Read `USAGE.md` → "Add a New Framework Skill" for the checklist
2. Create `.agents/skills/{framework}-conventions/SKILL.md`:
   - `name`: `{framework}-conventions`
   - `description`: keyword-rich, "Use when..." pattern
   - Body: build/test commands, directory conventions, language idioms
3. Add the framework to the table in `USAGE.md`
4. Add the skill to `.agents/scripts/bootstrap.sh` in the `case "$FRAMEWORK"` block
5. Update `docs/TECH-STACK.md` if relevant
6. Test: `./.agents/scripts/bootstrap.sh --dry-run --framework {name} /tmp/test`

## Procedure: Modify Core Rules

1. Read `generic-conventions/SKILL.md` fully — understand all current rules
2. Read all framework skills — check for conflicts with your change
3. Make the change to `generic-conventions/SKILL.md`
4. Update any framework skills that reference the changed rule
5. Update `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` if conventions changed
6. Run `./.agents/scripts/bootstrap.sh --dry-run` for each framework

## Procedure: Fix a Skill File

1. Check frontmatter: `---` fences, `name` matches folder, `description` is keyword-rich
2. Check body: clear "When to Use" section, one concern per skill, no duplicated docs content
3. Test: invoke the skill by name via its slash command

## File Dependencies Map

```
.agents/skills/generic-conventions/SKILL.md
  └── The definitive core rules (replaces the old monolithic AGENTS.md)
  ├── docs/ (always updated alongside code)
  ├── USAGE.md (references skill system)
  └── .agents/skills/generic-conventions/SKILL.md (loads core rules before every code change)

.agents/skills/{fw}-conventions/SKILL.md
  └── References generic-conventions, extends with framework-specific rules

.agents/skills/containers/SKILL.md → Dockerfile, Containerfile, docker-compose, .dockerignore
.agents/skills/shell-scripts/SKILL.md → .sh/.bash files
.agents/skills/sql-database/SKILL.md → .sql files, migrations
.agents/skills/api-design/SKILL.md → route/handler/api/controller files
.agents/skills/kubernetes/SKILL.md → k8s/helm/chart YAML files
.agents/skills/typescript-standalone/SKILL.md → .ts/.tsx files (non-Next.js)

.agents/skills/repo-context/SKILL.md → task: project identity and context
.agents/skills/generate-docs/SKILL.md → task: populate docs/ from codebase
.agents/skills/write-docs/SKILL.md → task: write READMEs, API docs, ADRs
.agents/skills/update-skills/SKILL.md → task: create, update, retire skills

.agents/hooks/ → lifecycle enforcement
.agents/scripts/bootstrap.sh → copies skills into target projects
.agents/scripts/hook-bootstrap.sh → auto-detect + bootstrap on session start
```

## Anti-Patterns to Watch For

- **Missing `name` or `description` frontmatter** — skill won't load or be discoverable
- **YAML frontmatter silent failures** — unescaped colons, tabs instead of spaces, missing `---` fences
- **Mixing concerns** — one skill for both testing AND styling AND API design
- **Contradictory rules** — core says "run tests", skill says "skip tests" without explanation
- **`name` mismatch** — `name` in frontmatter must match the folder name exactly
- **Duplicating docs in skills** — link to docs instead: `See docs/TESTING.md for conventions`
- **Creating skills without scanning first** — always run the detection checklist before creating; don't create skills for patterns that don't exist
- **Too many skills** — each skill costs context. If two skills overlap 80%, merge them
- **Skills that are just docs** — if a skill only links to docs, it should just be a docs entry
