# AGENTS.md — Skill System Protocol

## 🔴 MANDATORY — Load Skills Before Acting

**Before writing code, running a command, or responding to any request, you MUST check which skills apply.** This is not optional. Skills contain 🔴 HARD RULEs that override everything else. Ignoring them produces broken code, hung terminals, and security issues.

## 🔴 Session Startup Checklist

Before responding to the user's first request, complete these 4 steps:

1. **Match skills to request** — Read the quick-reference table below. For each skill, check the "Use when" column against the user's request and the files you might edit.
2. **Load every matching skill** — Read the full SKILL.md (`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) of every skill that applies.
3. **Note the 🔴 HARD RULEs** — Skills use 🔴 to mark mandatory rules. These take priority over everything else.
4. **Invoke `/repo-context`** for project identity and `/help` for the full catalog.

## 🔴 Before Every Action — Pre-Flight Check

| You're about to... | Check this skill |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Edit a source file | Framework skill for that file type (`.py` → `python-conventions`, `.go` → `go-conventions`, `.rs` → `rust-conventions`, `.tsx` → `nextjs-conventions`, `.ts` outside Next → `typescript-standalone`) |
| Run a terminal command | `local-model-commands` — **never use `&`, never infinite-wait** |
| Create a new file/service | `project-structure` — layering, naming, boundaries |
| Write/run tests | `useful-tests` — lifecycle, assertions, CI readiness |
| Edit Docker/K8s | `containers` / `kubernetes` |
| Edit shell scripts | `shell-scripts` — `set -euo pipefail`, quoting |
| Edit SQL/migrations | `sql-database` — parameterized queries, indexing |

## 🔴 Mandatory Skills

**These are NOT suggestions. You MUST load them before ANY action.**

| Skill | Why mandatory |
|-------|--------------|
| `generic-conventions` | Comments, docs sync, DRY, security, error handling, git. Applies to EVERYTHING. |
| `model-profiles` | Know your model's capabilities, context limits, and prompt preferences — adapt accordingly. |
| `local-model-commands` | **ALL terminal commands** — never `&`, never infinite-wait. |
| `debugging-patterns` | Systematic debugging — isolation, bisection, log-driven. Do not guess, methodically isolate. |
| `useful-tests` | Test lifecycle, assertions, CI readiness. Tests must catch real bugs, not pass trivially. |
| `project-structure` | Layering, naming, boundaries. No `utils/` dirs, no flat `src/`. |
| `error-interpretation` | Map error signatures to their root cause. Do not chase the wrong fix. |
| `self-correction-patterns` | Backtracking triggers, verification loops, assumption checking. Do not double down on wrong answers. |
| `skill-load` | **Session init** — `/skill-load` injects the bootstrap payload. First message, every session. |
| `api-design` | REST status codes, error shapes, versioning, auth, pagination, rate limiting, idempotency. |
| `shell-scripts` | `set -euo pipefail`, double-quote all vars, `trap cleanup EXIT`, `mktemp`. |
| `sql-database` | Parameterized queries only, reversible migrations, indexing, connection pooling. |
| `typescript-standalone` | Strict tsconfig, type safety, error handling, async patterns, Node.js conventions. |
| `agent-pipelines` | AI agent orchestration, state checkpoints, crash recovery, multi-phase pipelines. |
| `gitignore` | Ignore file patterns, structure, rules for `.gitignore`. |
| `postgresql-optimization` | JSONB, array types, full-text search, window functions, extensions. |
| `code-review-checklist` | Security, correctness, performance, readability, testing. |
| `refactoring-recipes` | Extract method, invert conditional, replace magic number — before/after patterns. |
| `cli-toolkit` | jq, curl, sed, awk, find, xargs, grep — shell pipeline reference. |
| `regex-reference` | Common patterns, language-specific escaping, catastrophic backtracking prevention. |
| `git-workflows` | Rebase vs merge, bisect, reflog recovery, conventional commits, clean history. |
| `web-design-reviewer` | UI/UX inspection, responsive design, accessibility, layout breakage. |
| `chrome-devtools` | Browser screenshots, performance profiling, network analysis. |
| `github-issues` | Create, update, manage issues — labels, assignees, milestones, dependencies. |
| `playwright-mcp` | Browser automation — navigate, click, type, snapshot pages. |

## Self-Improvement — Grow the System

This skill system evolves. **You are responsible for growing it.** Hooks automatically remind you at session start and periodically during your session.

- **New patterns?** → `/update-skills` detects gaps and creates skills
- **Changed skills?** → `/audit-skills` keeps docs consistent
- **Added/removed skills?** → `/update-skill-index` regenerates the index
- **All changes** → Log to `.agents/skills/learnings.md`

**Hook-driven reminders:**
- **SessionStart**: Loads the abbreviated checklist — match skills, load them, note HARD RULEs
- **PostToolUse**: Every ~10 tool calls, reminds you to log new patterns to learnings.md and run `/update-skills` if you created new conventions

If you don't invoke these, nothing improves. **Check `.agents/skills/` after every session. Look for ways to improve skills.**
