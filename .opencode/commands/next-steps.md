# next-steps

Append a bug, issue, or feature request to the tracking document `next-steps-plan/next-steps.md`.

## Usage

```
/next-steps <description>
```

## What it does

1. Reads the current `next-steps-plan/next-steps.md` to understand its structure (sections, subsections, and existing numbering)
2. Intelligently categorizes the input:
   - **Bug** (under `## Bugs`) if the description mentions a broken page, malfunction, error, or fix
   - **Feature** (under `## Features`) if the description describes new functionality, a new page, or new capability
3. For Bugs, further categorizes under the right subsection based on what page/component the bug is about:
   - `### /projects` — bugs on the `/projects` or `/archive` page
   - `### /Skills` — bugs on the `/skills` page or skill-related behavior
   - `### /logs` — log/monitoring issues
   - `### /mail` — bugs on the `/mail` page or email functionality
   - `### /mcp-servers` — bugs on the `/mcp-servers` page or MCP tool behavior
   - `### /observations` — bugs on the `/observations` page or observation pipeline
   - `### /personality` — bugs on the `/personality` page or trait pipeline
   - `### /tasks` — bugs on the `/tasks` kanban board
   - `### /jobs` — bugs on the `/jobs` page
   - `## opencode CLIENT BUGS` — plugin errors, client-side failures, OpenCode startup issues
   - If the page isn't recognized, add under a new subsection matching the page name
4. For Features:
   - Creates a new `### FEATURE-NAME` subsection if one doesn't exist for that feature
   - Appends the entry under the matching feature subsection
5. Auto-numbers the new entry within its section (finds the highest existing number and adds +1)
6. Appends the formatted entry at the end of its section using this format:
   - Bugs: `N. Description text here.`
   - Features: `N. Description text here.`
7. Shows a confirmation message: `Added as Bug #N under ### /section: description` or `Added as Feature #N under ### FEATURE-NAME: description`

## Categorization rules

- **Keyword-based bug detection**: Words like "broken", "error", "bug", "fails", "doesn't work", "not loading", "blank", "grey on grey", "crash", "wrong", "missing" indicate a bug
- **Page/component detection**: Scan for `/projects`, `/skills`, `/logs`, `/mail`, `/mcp-servers`, `/observations`, `/personality`, `/tasks`, `/jobs`
- **OpenCode client bugs**: References to "opencode client", "plugin error", "opencode.json", "package.json", "failed to install plugin", or OpenCode startup issues → `## opencode CLIENT BUGS`
- **Feature detection**: Phrases like "add", "create", "new page", "build", "implement", "would like", "want a" (without error/bug language) indicate a feature
- **New feature sections**: If the feature doesn't match an existing `###` heading under `## Features`, create a new `### FEATURE-NAME` section (e.g., `### ADD NEW PAGE: /jobs`, `### dark mode`)

## When to use

- When you find a bug: `/next-steps /skills code blocks are grey on grey and unreadable`
- When you want a new feature: `/next-steps add dark mode toggle to the dashboard`
- When you find an issue: `/next-steps /projects archived tab needs a search bar`
- When the plugin throws an error: `/next-steps plugin error on startup: failed to install observer.ts`
- During code review or QA when you spot a problem

## Important

- **Do NOT overwrite or reformat** the existing `next-steps-plan/next-steps.md`. Only append new numbered entries at the end of their respective sections.
- **Preserve existing numbering.** If the highest number in a section is `6`, the new entry gets `7`.
- **Match formatting exactly.** Bugs use `N. Description.` under `### /section`. Features use `N. Description.` under `### FEATURE-NAME`.
- If an `## Bugs` or `## Features` heading doesn't exist yet, create it at the top of the file.
- Add the Documentation References table (from the template) only if the file is empty or newly created.
